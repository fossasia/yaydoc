# Specifying Yaydoc Configurations
In order to generate and deploy documentation for a registered repository, Yaydoc reads configurations from a YAML file. 
To get started with Yaydoc the first step is to create a file named `.yaydoc.yml` and specify the required options.The 
configuration file is divided into four sections. 

## metadata
Following is a description of config options under the `metadata` section and it's example usage.

<!-- markdown+ -->
| Key | Description | Default |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| author      | The author of the repository. It is used to construct the copyright text.                | user/organization |
| projectname | The name of the project. This would be displayed on the generated documentation.         | Name of the repository |
| version     |	The version of the project. This would be displayed alongside the project name           | Current UTC date |
| debug       | If true, the logs generated would be a little more verbose. Can be one of true or false. | true |
| inline_math | Whether inline math should be enabled. This only affects markdown documents.             | false |
| autoindex   | This section contains various settings to control the behavior of the auto generated index. Use this to customize the starting page while having the benefit of not having to specify a manual index. | _none_ |
<!-- endmarkdown+ -->

```yaml
metadata:
  author: FOSSASIA
  projectname: Yaydoc
  version: development
  debug: true

Note that currently this option is only used for parsing any included documents using the mdinclude directive and it's unlikely to change soon. | markdown_github |
| mock             | Any python modules or packages which should be mocked. This only makes sense if the project is in python and uses autodoc has C dependencies. | _none_ |
