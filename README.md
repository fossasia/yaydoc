## Getting started

### Prerequisites
To start using Yaydoc, make sure you have all of the following:
- [GitHub](https://github.com) login
- Project [hosted as a repository](https://help.github.com/categories/importing-your-projects-to-github/) on GitHub
- Project containing a directory (`source`) containing all the markup files

> __Note:__  For advanced configurations, include an `index.rst` file which contains 
[toctrees](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/toctree.html) to link the various documents.

### To get started with Yaydoc
1. Using your Github account, sign in to [yaydoc.org](http://yaydoc.org) and accept the Github 
[access permissions confirmation](docs/user_manual/github-oauth-scopes.md)
2. Once you’re signed in to Yaydoc, go to your dashboard and register the repository you want to build your 
documentation from.
3. Add a [.yaydoc.yml](docs/user_manual/yaydoc_configuration.md) file to the root of your repository to define rules and variables for Yaydoc's build process
4. Add the `.yaydoc.yml` file to git, commit and push, to trigger the Yaydoc build process.
5. Check the logs for your repository to see if the documentation generation and deployment process passes or fails.

> __Note:__ Yaydoc only runs builds on the commits you push after you’ve registered your repository in Yaydoc. Ensure 
that the repository is enabled from the its settings at Yaydoc.

## Known limitations
- If you use embedded html in markdown or reStructuredText, any static content such as images, javascript referred from it should be present in a `_static` directory placed under **source**.
